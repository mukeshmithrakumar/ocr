  "data": "Deep learning is the main representative of the breakthrough in artificial intelligence today it has reached nearly human level in image classification speech recognition natural language processing and so on the method of deep learning is developing rapidly which almost subverts all branches of computer vision field however the fundamental problem of deep learning at present is the lack of theoretical research on its internal principles and there is no accepted theoretical explanation namely the socalled black box problem why use such a deep model in deep learning why is deep learning successful whats the key inside the lack of theoretical basis has led to the academic community being unable to explain the fundamental reason for the success of deep learning the theoretical basis is not clear and we simply do not know from what angle to look at it the black box model is purely based on data without considering the physical laws of the model it lacks the ability to adhere to mechanistic understandings of the underlying physical processes hence even if the model achieves high accuracy but it lacks of theoretical support it can not be used as a basis for subsequent scientific developments we must not rely solely on intuition designed algorithmic structures and several empirically tried examples to prove the general validity of an algorithm this research method has the potential to learn false modes from nongeneric representations of data the explanatory nature of the model is very low and the resulting research results are difficult to pass on in the long term as peoples new ideas have been replaced by more and more complex model architectures which are almost invisible under the weight of layers of models calls for attention to the explanatory nature of machine learning are also getting higher therefore we need to thoroughly understand the entire system operation of deep learning we need to explain what the most fundamental problems are in the field of deep learning and whether. These fundamental issues are mature enough to be accurately described in mathematical and physical languages.
